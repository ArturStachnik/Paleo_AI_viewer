# Paleo AI Residual Viewer

**Paleo AI Viewer** is a Jupyter Notebook that loads Holocene paleotemperature data, applies an ensemble of trained neural networks, and visualizes the results as an interactive scatter plot comparing predicted and true temperature values.

The viewer includes a dropdown menu to color-code the data points by season, proxy type, or archive type, enabling intuitive exploration of the model's predictions.

## How to Use

### Run in Google Colab

1. Click the "Open in Colab" badge below.
2. Execute all cells in order.
3. The notebook will:
   - Clone this repository
   - Load the dataset and models
   - Generate the interactive scatter plot

> **Note**: If you open the notebook directly from Colab, cloning the repo will still fetch the models and data automatically.

## Output: Residuals Interactive Plot

The final cell generates a scatter plot of predicted vs. true temperatures, including:

- A diagonal reference line for perfect prediction (y = x)
- Color dropdown to group points by:
  - Season (`annual`, `warm`, `cold`)
  - Proxy type
  - Archive type

## Customization Tips for the Graph

To adjust the appearance of the graph, modify this section inside the notebook:

```python
fig.update_layout(
    yaxis_scaleanchor="x",
    height=1000,
    width=2000,
    ...
)
```
